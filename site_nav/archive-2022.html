	<em><b>November 12, 2022</b><br>
	<br>
	Development focus for Harmonious Platform Systems has shifted to specification version 4.0.
	</em>
	</p>

	<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:gold; padding:1em; font-size:50%;">
	<em><b>November 11, 2022</b><br>
	<br>
	The Harmonious Platform Systems internal website is now hosted on OpenBSD.
	<br>
	The Freedom Publishers Union internal website has become the first website to be hosted on Gobble blockchain technology.
	<br>
	The former was a reasonably simple transition but the latter has been a huge effort and has required delicate, precise development.
	<br>
	We are proud to report the transition of both websites was seamless and no downtime was experienced.

	<em><b>August 21, 2022</b><br>
	<br>
	We are now hosting Redmine in-house and will be used for all our project management services.
	<br>
	We are no longer using Atlassian.
	</em>
	</p>

	<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:gold; padding:1em; font-size:50%;">
	<em><b>August 17, 2022</b><br>
	<br>
	Harmonious Platform Systems has been using the services of RedminePRO.
	<br>
	Not only were we using it for internal project management, but also using it to manage projects for our partners.
	<br>
	For unknown reasons, we have had our account locked and have been unable to receive any assistance from RedminePRO.
	<br>
	Harmonious Platform Systems strives to be 100% free and independent of big tech and other service providers.
	<br>
	However, sometimes we are still placed in a position, due to limited resources, to rely on outside service providers.
	<br>
	It's just the nature of the technology business and sometimes cannot be avoided.
	<br>
	RedminePRO has been one of our service providers and has been very good, when we had account access.
	<br>
	When our account was locked, we received no notification prior to it being locked and no notification after it was locked.
	<br>
	We only learned of it being locked when we attempted to routinely log in to our account.
	<br>
	Despite our repeated requests for support, we have been unable to get any response, at all, from RedminePRO.
	<br>
	We attempted to contact them using live support chat and we were ignored.
	<br>
	We contacted them using email and we were ignored.
	<br>
	We opened a support ticket and it was immediately closed.
	<br>
	We reopened the support ticket and despite it remaining open, we continue to be ignored.
	<br>
	The lack of support and lack of response from RedminePRO is very disappointing and frankly, pathetic.
	<br>
	As a result of our experience with RedminePRO, we unfortunately cannot recommend their services and we urge all to avoid and seek out 
	alternative service providers.
	<br>
	Our experience with RedminePRO and its lack of care towards clients serves as a prime example of why Harmonious Platform Systems was 
	created, why we strive to be 100% free of big tech and to be entirely independent, hosting all of our technology in-house.
	<br>
	We do not yet have the available resources in-house to be hosting Redmine on our network, therefore we have been forced to use 
	third-party service provider, Atlassian, at this time.

	<em><b>June 24, 2022</b><br>
	<br>
	We have successfully upgraded Gobble Chain to version 3.0.
	<br>
	This was not anticipated and come as a result of some very unexpected circumstances.
	<br>
	Late yesterday the blockchain crashed because of technical reasons that were unforeseen and of which we never developed for.
	<br>
	We had recently introduced a new backup mechanism which duplicated the current running blockchain into an archive of its own.
	<br>
	Initially things looked promising but we seriously misjudged just how quickly the running blockchain grows and equally misjudged how 
	quickly disk space would be consumed by duplicating it for archival, without any compression.
	<br>
	It was primarily the lack of disk storage space on the server which caused the entire blockchain to stop functioning and effectively 
	break.
	<br>
	It was an oversight which we readily admit should not have happened and that is on us.
	<br>
	This morning we were forced to dump version 2.0 entirely and quickly adopt version 3.0, and make some necessary changes to see it 
	implemented with confidence.
	<br>
	It has been a complete success.
	<br>
	Version 3.0 of Gobble Chain replicates the exact same behavior as its predecessor, but with some critical modifications.
	<br>
	The amount of disk space its predecessor consumed had become unmanageable for the resources that we have and to be honest, it was just 
	unnecessarily bloated by design - something we never understood, until yesterday.
	<br>
	Version 3.0 introduces a much leaner design, functions much lighter by using a half-load data addition model to the blockchain while using 
	less system resources, consumes so much less disk space and introduces a brand new compressed archival feature.
	<br>
	The new blockchain is now operational and running successfully.
	<br>
	The changes have no effect on current investments of CMDC and its values, which all remains unchanged by the implementation of this new 
	version.
	<br>
	So, as we said, this update comes much earlier than we anticipated, but we were presented with an immediate challenge and are proud of 
	what we have been able to do to meet that challenge.

	<em><b>June 14, 2022</b><br>
	<br>
	Mozilla Firefox has been certified for use with Harmonious Platform Systems.
	<br>
	The two candidates for certification were Mozilla Firefox and Brave Browser.
	<br>
	This was a challenging decision for us, considering both candidates are respectable web browsers.
	<br>
	Mozilla Firefox has been certified over Brave Browser on the basis that we feel Mozilla, through Firefox and as an organization, 
	is more dedicated to the freedom movement than what Brave Browser is.
	<br>
	This is no way negates any efforts that Brave Browser has made and continues to make, especially with its focus on security and 
	privacy, but we feel their intentions are more focused towards improving their own products and services rather than the freedom 
	movement as a whole.
	<br>
	We actually considered certifying both candidates, however, we definitely feel more work needs to be done with Brave Browser to 
	reach the point where we are completely satisfied it can be certified for use with Harmonious Platform Systems.
	<br>
	Because we have not yet reached that point of satisfaction, Brave Browser will not be certified at this time.
	<br>
	We will continue to monitor the development progress of Brave Browser and if significant improvements are made we are open to 
	certify its use in the future.

	<em><b>May 15, 2022</b><br>
	<br>
	We are currently reviewing the "Harmonious Access Browser" component of the specification.
	<br>
	We had plans to ship a custom web browser with modifications made specifically to suit the Harmonious Platform.
	<br>
	However, after much consideration we have decided that shipping a custom browser is both unnecessary and negated by the fact that 
	good web browsers already exist that already function well with Harmonious Platform.
	<br>
	In place of shipping a custom web browser, we'd like to endorse an existing web browser and certify it's compatibility with 
	Harmonious Platform.
	<br>
	We have not yet finalized which web browser we will certify, but both Mozilla Firefox and Brave Browser remain the two most likely 
	candidates.

	We are currently investigating a security breach which has penetrated our network.

	Our initial assessment points to a Mainframe breach.

	This is both good and bad.
