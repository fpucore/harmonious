	<p><strong>Interview with OSTechNix - October 31, 2016</strong></p>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>How did you first become interested in the concept of software freedom 
	and the open-source software movement?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was way back in 2002 when I was an avid reader of computer and technology 
	magazines.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was when they used to include a CD-ROM disc on the cover each month 
	which contained all the latest software and program updates.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There was one particular month that I bought a magazine and it contained 
	SUSE Linux 8.0 on the front cover.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">At the time I was naive and thought that Windows was the only operating 
	system for desktop users.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I had no idea there were other choices and prior to this moment I had 
	never heard of Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Naturally curiosity got the better of me and I booted from the disc into 
	SUSE Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">When I booted into this brand new operating system I was blown away by 
	what I witnessed.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was a feeling of instant excitement and amazement.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I still remember the feeling to this day.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The more I poked around inside SUSE Linux the more excited I got.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Two important things I remember from that day have had a major influence on 
	what I do as a profession.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I couldn't believe there was an alternative desktop operating system that was 
	not Microsoft Windows.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Also, I kept wondering to myself why I did not know anything about Linux prior 
	to this moment.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To me it felt like this really cool operating system that gave users real choice 
	was being kept a big secret.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">And I had been given access to that secret.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I instantly felt compelled from that moment on to share my new knowledge with 
	my fellow computing community.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The spark inside me had been set alight and the fire within still burns strong 
	to this day.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Do you work with Linux and open-source software as a professional, or 
	is it just a hobby?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">What started out as a hobby gradually opened up more and more opportunities 
	for me to share my knowledge and experience that I had learned from Linux and open-source software.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Many years ago, before people even knew what blogs were, I was writing about 
	technology and computer news for a small website I had set up.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">This spawned into a love for technical writing.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I worked on my own websites and then began to help others with their 
	websites.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Casual writing jobs turned into full-time gigs.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Then I landed myself a role as chief editor for a popular Linux and open-source 
	software news site.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I performed in the role for about one year before I started to get 
	frustrated.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It seemed that I was not alone with my frustrations.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So I made note that I was leaving and would form my own media website, and was 
	lucky enough that many of my previous staff followed me onto the new platform.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Projects that I am now involved in started very small.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Now, they've developed into full-time roles which I literally work on 7 days a 
	week to keep everything alive and thriving, with some help from my loyal colleagues.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">At times I get very tired and question myself as to whether it is all worth it, 
	to be so dedicated to sharing my knowledge and skills of free and open-source software in the public domain.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I reach the same answer each and every time - it is absolutely worth it.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>How do you think Linux is shaping up against the latest evolution of Windows 
	10 and Apple OS X?</b></div></font>
<br>	
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">That's always a really tough question to answer.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">People need to remember that Linux itself is not a commercial entity.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's a kernel that is the base for other operating systems.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Sure, there are commercial entities that have been built around the core that is 
	Linux, such as Red Hat and Canonical.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But Linux itself doesn't have to compete in the same way Microsoft is competing 
	against Apple and vice versa.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Looking at Linux 1.0 and then looking at the latest stable versions of Linux in 
	2016, heading into 2017, it has undoubtedly evolved.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There's a massive amount of support for it now and contributions to kernel 
	development is applied from so many different sectors of the industry.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's literally mind boggling how far it has come.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">People ask all the time, "When is Linux going to take over the desktop?".</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I say, well it was never the intention.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">If Linux did go ahead and take over that would create just another 
	monopoly.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I am not against commercial software and believe that we need diversity in the 
	sector.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Consumers need to have a choice of operating systems.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Linux is essentially providing that third choice if that's what consumers 
	want.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">What I am against is locking down hardware so that third-party software is 
	effectively blocked from being installed.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Microsoft have tried this and for many years Apple done it.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To a large degree, they're still doing it.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Richard Stallman has spoke about this recently and I absolutely agree with 
	him.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">An open platform and framework for hardware should be pursued because if it's not, 
	we're going to see commercial computer vendors locking down systems with even more strict hardware methods than what we see today.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">That could cause problems for open-source software and Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Or, it may spawn a new generation of hardware hackers determined to get it 
	installed and bypass any potential hardware restrictions that are placed in front of them.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Which Linux distribution do you use and why?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I operate a server which runs Linux Mint, which is essentially a tweaked version of 
	Ubuntu.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I always stick to the Ubuntu platform as my primary operating system.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I also run a couple of others in VirtualBox - Ubuntu 16.10, Fedora 25 and OpenSUSE 
	42.2, the latter two being development builds.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">As part of my work I'm constantly playing around with new versions of Linux 
	distributions on physical hardware and virtual machines.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So I'm very adaptable to any Linux environment that I am placed in front 
	of.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Do you use any other operating systems other than Linux? If yes, which others 
	do you use?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Yes, our office laptop runs Windows 10.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">And we're also considering a new purchase of an Apple laptop in the first half of 
	2017 as part of our small business expansion plans.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Like I mentioned earlier, we need diversity in the sector and that ethos is echoed 
	here in the office.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We simply don't restrict ourselves to one sole platform or operating system.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Microsoft has done an excellent job with Windows 10 and reestablished confidence in 
	the Windows platform.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We might not agree with the marketing practices of Apple, but no one can deny that they 
	do produce beautifully designed hardware that can be appreciated by anyone that understands quality design.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Are you involved in software development or any other projects as part of the free 
	software movement?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I have developed a few pieces of code, yes.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">One of my personal favorites that I developed is Powershell-Bash.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was developed a few years ago to attempt to ease the burden for system administrators 
	who regularly switch between Powershell and Bash environments.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I developed Powershell-Bash to use a sub-selection of the Powershell syntax to perform 
	the same equivalent function in a Bash environment on Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's not really as necessary now that Microsoft is developing Powershell to run natively 
	on Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But for now it still serves its purpose well and I still continue with its development, 
	along with a small integrated package management program which cuts down long apt-get commands to much shorter length, with performing the exact same 
	functions.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Additionally, I have developed a couple of programming languages which are not yet 
	complete to any kind of workable state.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">They require a hell of a lot more debugging before I release those into the 
	wild.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">More recent stuff has included an encryption algorithm called Numerical-Data-Scrambling, 
	which I refer to as simply NDS.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Work is ongoing on this, but it's coming along nicely.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I have a couple of other smaller packages that I have developed over the last 5 years, 
	but nothing groundbreaking and mostly just used for internal purpose.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">With age, comes coding laziness and it has turned me into a bit of a script junkie these 
	days.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">In my spare time I like to give back to the FOSS community.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I do this by dedicating 1-2 hours a week to sitting on Ubuntu Support Channel on 
	IRC.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Helping out people who are completely new to the Linux experience is always 
	satisfying.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Plus, I believe it's good to give back to a community in return for everything that it 
	has given me.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I'm also a pretty passionate advocate for Creative Commons and Tor.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Who are your inspirations?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I have many inspirations so I'll try and narrow it down to just a few and keep my reasons 
	brief.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Mark Zuckerberg, because he is part of a new generation of Silicon Valley moguls.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">He has developed the world most connected social media platform yet still shows every sign 
	of his original self when Facebook was in its early days.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">He is still young and already made such a massive impact on connecting the world.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Absolute brilliance.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are some of the two most interesting, inspirational individuals who 
	both undoubtedly massively contributed and helped shaped the industry we see today.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Gates continues his efforts to better humanity using his great wealth for philanthropic 
	purposes.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Jobs was an extremely complex individual yet somehow provided inspiration to so many, despite 
	his brutal work ethics.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Opinion on Jobs may differ greatly, yet I still believe him to be a very inspirational person, 
	albeit complex.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There is only several people that I would describe as a genius.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Stephen Hawkings is textbook genius.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I don't believe I would come across anyone that would dispute that.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">He has made massive contributions to help shape modern science, physics and 
	cosmology.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">He may be disabled, yet he never lost his intelligence and is never shy to put his wonderful 
	sense of humor on public display.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I just love the guy.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There are probably others that provide inspiration to me, for a variety of different 
	reasons.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Richard Stallman being an inspiration to so many individuals among the freedom software 
	movement is also worthy of a mention.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Dennis M. Ritchie, Ian Murdock, Aaron Swartz, Julian Assange, the list goes on and on and 
	on.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The people I have mentioned might seem mediocre, yet they are in-fact making real visible 
	change in the world and the effect of their actions is being felt by so many.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Sadly a number of them are no longer with us.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But the effects of their contributions are still felt today, which justifies their status 
	for inspiration.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>What are your thoughts for Microsoft aggressively embracing Linux through the Windows 
	subsystem for Linux?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's absolutely commendable.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">And I don't honestly believe that it would have happened if Satya Nadella had not been 
	appointed [Microsoft] CEO.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To integrate native Linux inside Windows without the requirement for running third-party 
	virtual machine software is incredible.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">As a developer, I can really appreciate the extra hurdles that have essentially been removed 
	for us as a result of the subsystem for Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">This comes in addition to Powershell being open-sourced and developed to run natively on 
	Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It is really putting Microsoft's efforts to open up collaboration with open-source software 
	and the community on display, and good things can only come of it.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Integration and collaboration between operating systems and platforms can only bring 
	positive results.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I look forward to the future.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>What does the future hold for the free software movement?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There will be progress, but I don't really think we're going to see anything we have not yet 
	witnessed.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Most likely just improvements.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Open-source software will continue to be developed, modified and adopted across an entire 
	range of technology and its associated sectors.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">What should be of concern is keeping hardware open to allow for open-source software to be 
	applied in its intended form, rather than resort to hacking.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It will be interesting to see where this goes heading into the next 5-10 years.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But we must not sit idle and wait for it to happen.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We must be part of the fight to prevent it from happening.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>How do you think open-source software could be used to improve and better the overall 
	security of servers and systems?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Short answer, it's already doing a very good job.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">And if implemented and administered as it should be, it will do the job of security very 
	well.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Usually data breaches or hacks are accessed because someone has essentially 'left the door 
	open' due to incompetence or lack of human resources.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Sometimes this is unintentional by the individuals.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">In most cases, the latter is most likely the cause for concern here.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Skimming on human ability to implement proper software security will have a flow-on effect 
	and hackers will look for easy targets, and take advantage of this point.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's that simple.</div></font><br>
