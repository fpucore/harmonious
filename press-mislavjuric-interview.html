	<p><strong>Interview with Mislav Jurić - July 8, 2020</strong></p>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Introduce yourself.</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">First of all, thank you very much Mislav for inviting me to be on the program.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I am a Linux technologist and writer, and I work out of my office here on the 
	Gold Coast in Australia.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Many will know me as the co-founder of Freedom Publishers Union but I'm actually 
	involved in many different projects and I write about a lot of different stuff – Linux, free and open source software, freedom of 
	information, digital rights, privacy and even politics.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">And I'm also a public advocate for Creative Commons and the Tor Project.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Your career so far, what have you worked on?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">My semi-professional career with Linux started sometime in the years leading up to 
	2010.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I can't remember exactly what year it was but I was writing about Linux gaming for some 
	independent website.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was only a very casual role and the website operations eventually fell apart anyway during 
	my brief tenure.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I think the owner had just lost interest or something, I have no idea.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Anyway, after that brief introduction to the world of technical writing I started my own 
	technology blog which was operated from home and accessible on some random subdomain.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I was just writing about general computer and technology news.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was basic and nothing I was taking very serious at the time.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But I did begin to take a particular interest in Linux related news.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">After I decided to ditch my own independent website, which admittedly was extremely amateur, I 
	met some people online who were generous enough to provide me with the opportunity to write for their website.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So I started working as a technical writer for Unixmen.com.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I got on very well with my colleagues and I eventually took over the publishing operations as 
	Chief Editor.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I continued in the role as Chief Editor for a couple of years before the website operations 
	kind of imploded.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To be frank with you, I don't really know what went wrong behind the scenes for everything to 
	implode the way it did.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was all really out of my control.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I eventually left anyway, but then something really interesting happened.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Most of the staff that were also working for Unixmen also decided to leave.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Some left immediately and some continued for a little while longer, but eventually we all 
	left.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I really don't know whatever happened to the site, the domain navigates to the old website but 
	it hasn't been updated for years.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But anyway, some of the staff joined me in a new project I was working on, which would soon 
	become Freedom Publishers Union.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Some of the staff assisted me where they could, but a few new projects also spawned.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Now, there's two websites – OSTechNix and OSRadar – they are operated independently of each 
	other, as his Freedom Publishers Union.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But OSTechNix is actually a co-owner of Freedom Publishers Union.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So, despite the independent nature of business of all these operations, we all still co-operate 
	together and assist each other as Linux family.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The irony of it all is the death of one Linux website actually spawned three new Linux 
	websites.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I speak specifically for Freedom Publishers Union here, but if you are to read over the broad 
	range of topics of the articles that we now have published in our archive, you'd have no idea that Freedom Publishers Union was actually originally a fork 
	from a Linux website.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Freedom Publishers Union was not actually the original name, rather a name that was adopted 
	shortly after the original project was established.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So, as I said, we now publish articles on a range of different topics, across multiple mastheads 
	in several different countries across the world.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Still, I feel we've never forgotten or abandoned our heritage of being a simple Linux news and 
	reviews website.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We do still publish Linux related content, but it's all just handled very different 
	nowadays.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Freedom Publishers Union was officially founded in 2013.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Personally, I can't believe how quick time has gone and can't believe how many changes of 
	operations and structure we've had in such a short amount of time.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's quite ridiculous, really.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">For 5 or more years we were online and publicly accessible.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">For a long time we had been operating at a huge financial loss before we needed to find a new 
	way of staying in the publishing business, but without the requirement of continuing to pour cash into the project.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We've always had a strict no advertising policy in effect from day 1, so we had no real way to 
	generate any operating income through introducing advertising.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Anyway, the result has been the subscription based model we operate today.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We publish through a digital distribution platform called LinkNet.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We kind of resemble an underground newsletter which paid subscribers are provided access.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I mean, sure, this limits our exposure to a select few who are generous enough to pay for a 
	subscription to LinkNet, but it suits our operations and keeps us publishing, which we intend to keep doing for many more years.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We are not done yet.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To be honest I'm actually really happy with the reduced public exposure we now have.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Operating somewhat underground and at a much reduced pace is really satisfying and allows us to 
	concentrate on getting our content and articles close to perfection.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">As I mentioned, we only publish a small amount of Linux related articles now, under the masthead 
	of Tecseek Technology.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">For quite a while we were forced to halt publishing through that specific masthead while we 
	restructured.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But now that we have a new publishing model which we are happy with and seems to be working 
	well, we are now planning to increase the rate of publishing through the Tecseek Technology masthead.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">My colleagues at OSTechNix and OSRadar publish frequently.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I contribute to them where I can and vice versa, but I really need to commend the effort of my 
	colleagues who continue to put in many hours of tireless hard work to benefit the entire Linux and open source software communities.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>How did you get started with Linux?</b></div></font>
<br>	
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I started playing around with Linux in 2003, with SUSE Linux 8.0.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was a time when computer and technology news websites were still maturing into mainstream 
	platforms you see today.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So computer magazines were still popular and had loyal readership because they were genuinely 
	a beautiful thing to hold.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Some of those monthly additions were as thick as a novel.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Anyway, during this time you'll probably remember software was also being shipped on CD-ROMs 
	which were provided free on the front covers of the magazines.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">One issue of APC magazine I purchased from the newsagent came with a copy of SUSE Linux 
	8.0.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I specifically remember the version.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">At the time, Windows XP was really maturing and most people were starting to take it serious 
	as the version of Windows to have.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">History tells the story of just how popular Windows XP would become.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But when I booted SUSE Linux I was so impressed by what I saw.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But what particularly impressed me was the fact that I now understood that there was actually 
	a viable alternative to Windows.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Typically, when you use Windows as your operating system you get comfortable and forget there 
	are alternatives available.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">In 2003 I was still in the process of understanding that Windows alternatives were actually 
	usable but you had to be willing to make certain sacrifices in productivity because Linux for the desktop was still evolving at that point.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To see how usable and user-friendly it has become now is really encouraging from a developer's 
	perspective.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>How did your Linux understanding evolve over the years?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So, as I mentioned, I got my first feel for Linux in 2003, but to be honest I didn't really 
	adopt it as my full-time operating system until Ubuntu 5.10 arrived, or Breezy Badger, as its code name was.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I was using Linux pretty sparingly before then, so I usually always relied on Windows for 
	day-to-day tasks.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I can't remember how exactly I came to know of Ubuntu, but I bought a copy of Ubuntu 5.10 
	off eBay for like 5 bucks or something, and it really did change absolutely everything for me.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It blew me away and it clearly demonstrated to me that Linux was ready for the consumer 
	desktop and had broken down the walls of being limited to servers.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I kind of have a soft spot for Ubuntu 5.10 and when asked what my favourite version of Linux 
	is I always say Ubuntu 5.10.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Fedora Core 5 also impressed me equally.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">That was a great release.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Thinking about it, Ubuntu 5.10 was actually the last 32-bit Linux operating system I would 
	use.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">From Ubuntu 6.04 onwards I switched to 64-bit.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Since then, like most Linux users I guess, I have distro hopped back and forth for work 
	reasons and personal reasons.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I had a good run with openSUSE for a while but when they transitioned the KDE desktop 
	from version 3 base to the Plasma 4 base I got kind of annoyed.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I always felt the version 3 base was a really good environment and have always remained a 
	little frustrated, I guess you could say, about the switch to the Plasma 4 base.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">After that I switched to Fedora and had a good run with that too.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The truth is, compared to early days of Linux on the desktop we are now spoiled for 
	choice.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There is not one, two or three good distributions available, there's just so many.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Now, many of them are derivatives but they are so mature in development that I think they 
	are worthy of independent recognition.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Yes, it is true Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian, and this fact often goes 
	unrecognized.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But Ubuntu is so much its own distribution now that it does deserve independent 
	recognition.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">And I think it gets it.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Linux Mint and Manjaro Linux are also a couple of additional projects that should be 
	recognized for the individual identity they've established.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Dig around, there's so much choice now.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Some argue it is too much choice, but I'm not convinced you can have too much 
	choice.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It is the beauty of open-source software.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">You need to allow for it to be forked, modified and shared organically without limits or 
	boundaries.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I find it difficult to backtrack where exactly I fell in love with coding.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I think it goes back to my childhood when the family had a Commodore 64.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I mean, who didn't love writing programs in BASIC on a Commodore.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It was good times.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">In high school my love of source code grew stronger when we studied programming and were 
	using QBasic. From then until now it has just been a passion that continues to grow stronger.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I've played around with many programming languages but seem to have built myself a comfort 
	zone by settling in with a simplistic set of languages.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">HTML of course, Bash, Python and Perl.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Occasionally I will break out C or C++ but it has become more rare these days as I settle 
	down and find I can get most things churned out by coding scripts.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Scripts are great and they are so much fun to work with.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">One of the most interesting programming languages I wrote a program it once was 
	Haskell.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">That was a while ago now, but it turned out to function very well and I enjoyed coding in 
	Haskell.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Typically, Linux users are asked do they prefer Emacs or Vim.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To be honest, I don't really favour either.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I now code in nano.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I have it set up just the way I like to work using a custom configuration.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So like I said before, my work these days has been much more simplified.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Much like my habits of using my computers in console mode on Debian.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I no longer even have a graphical desktop environment.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's too distracting for what I do.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>What is your favorite Linux-related topic?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">That's a great question and I'd have to say I really enjoy testing and writing reviews 
	on the many great Linux graphical desktop environments.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I completely understand that might sound confusing since I clearly just said that I only 
	use a console, but the fact that I don't use a desktop environment also adds to the fun of testing them out.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It is always really interesting to have a really good poke around in an environment 
	that you're not entirely familiar with, especially when you don't use it on a daily basis.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I think that the current state of a desktop environment is also a good indicator of the 
	current development health of desktop Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">By that, I mean, I understand I have the advanced knowledge to operate a Linux computer 
	by console and not rely on a graphical desktop environment.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But I also accept that not everyone has the same level of knowledge or workload that 
	can be applied to such a minimal environment.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I get that and I respect that.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So it has to be accepted that for a Linux distribution to attract a user base, it's got 
	to have an easy to use, functioning graphical desktop environment.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So yeah, for someone in my position, it is always fun to see what tricks distribution 
	developers are implementing to attract a user base and to effectively compete with what is actually a really saturated market.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">If you want to call it a market.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Do you prefer Linux over other operating systems and if yes, why?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">That's easy, yes.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Absolutely.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I love Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I love it so much my own son is named Linus, after Torvalds himself.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">True story. Seriously though, I just think Linux sticks to the very purpose of why we have 
	computers in the first place, to get stuff done.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">That's a pretty vague answer, I know.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But let me put it this way, when I sit down at the computer I want it to respond to my 
	commands.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I mean the whole reason I am sitting there in the first place is to get a task done.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Linux allows me to do just that.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There's of course options to get Linux to do more, or less, than you want it to do, but at 
	the very core of it all it will only do as much as you want it to.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">With Windows, it's the complete opposite.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">First, I want to make it clear I do not hate Microsoft, at all.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But I do believe Microsoft have lost the vision for Windows and what it should be.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The problem is, it tries to be everything and do everything and this is just taking the 
	power away from the user by automating too much.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I think you'll agree that it's just made it bloated, slow and it's generally just cumbersome 
	to deal with.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">When I have to sit in front of the computer and I see it running Windows I literally sigh 
	out loud because I know I'm going to spend more time waiting for Windows to perform all the tasks it so unnecessarily does instead of just doing what 
	I want it to do.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">This has been a progressive problem for Windows.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Think back to Windows 3.1 and even Windows 2000.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">They were brilliant for exactly the type of computing I talk about and for how I personally 
	use a computer.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The point Windows 10 has reached has come from commercial pressures where developers are 
	continually forced to develop a product, and not a service, which has to impress by adding new features, encouraging upgrades and impressing 
	stockholders.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">You know how it works.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Linux based operating systems are all free and don't suffer from these same commercial 
	pressures.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">This has been really good for the Linux ecosystem because it's had the positive side effect 
	of holding Linux distributions back from adopting the same commercial temptations.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">What we see is Linux development focusing on the user instead, which is exactly how it 
	should be.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Unfortunately Windows just does not do that.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Do you think that people who use computers professionally (computer scientists, 
	software developers) should know how to use Linux?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Yes I do.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">However, it's difficult to apply uniformly across any entire industry.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">As to expect everyone to know how to use Linux we need to go right back and take a look at 
	what precise computer skills are taught in our high schools.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I've spoke about this problem on many occasions.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">When I was at high school, sure we learned some QBasic programming and some other cool stuff, 
	but the curriculum never moved off the Windows platform.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Unix was available at that time, but it was not even spoke about.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">These days, Linux fills the role of Unix and there's no reason it shouldn't be included into 
	the curriculum.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">To really start placing the expectation on any specific industry that they should learn how 
	to use Linux, it really does unlock a huge series of problems which needs fixing first, I think, before we start that conversation.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We need to reform education curriculum so that kids not only learn about Linux and how to 
	use it, but we also need to shift away from the work requirements that are central to the Microsoft Windows and Office platform.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">By this, I mean, we still see some schools requiring work to be performed on Windows based 
	computers and submitted in proprietary Microsoft Office formats.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I have no problem with the nature of proprietary formats, that's not really at the core of 
	the problem I'm getting at here.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's the stupid decisions that get made by those higher up at that don't really think too 
	broadly enough about this stuff.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's ridiculous.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Linux is perfectly capable of doing the same job equal to or better than anything on 
	Windows.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The computer education curriculums are developed on outdated ideology.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It needs to change.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So until we get off this constant reliance on Microsoft Windows and Office in our education 
	sectors, I can't see us getting any closer to having entire industries requiring knowledge of Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I sometimes feel like we've been having the same conversation for two decades or longer, 
	yet here we are, we haven't been able to move forward.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Consumer adoption of Linux has grown at incredible rates and I am really happy with that but 
	industry adoption still seems to be lagging.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I really would like to see that change very soon.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Can penetration testers (hackers) benefit from learning Linux?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Oh absolutely.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">You know, the term “hacker” is referenced in some strange ways.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There is still just way too many people that believe inaccurately that anyone who calls 
	themselves a hacker is up to no good or involved in something illegal.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">When I think of a hacker, I think of the mid to late 70s and into the 80s when hacking 
	cultures were really what seeded the development of much of the technology we use today.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Nostalgic nerds like Steve Wozniak.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">They were real hackers in the true form of the term.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">They often self-built hardware, coded and compiled their software by hand and in other cases 
	modified the code of existing software to adapt it to their own hacked hardware.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">All these activities were hacking.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Was it illegal?</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">No.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Was it evil?</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">No.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Nobody got hurt.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Where exactly in computer history the term hacking became so referenced with such evil 
	activities, I really don't know the answer to that.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">But back to your original question, I think learning Linux could be determined to be a 
	necessity for penetration testers.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Penetration testing will almost always present the hacker, or tester, with hardware and 
	platforms which are not limited to a single operating system platform or architecture.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">In this area, the broader your skill set is the more you will excel at the task and increase 
	the chances of getting positive. This one is a no-brainer.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Do you think everyone can benefit from learning Linux?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I can't possibly see how anyone could argue to the contrary.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I mean, I spoke about this before when I mentioned reforming school curriculums to adopt 
	the inclusion of Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There is multiple angles to assess.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">You see, if more businesses start rolling out Linux based computers in the office without 
	staff knowing how to use Linux, you are going to have some seriously stressed staff and a nightmare scenario for tech support.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Yet, if you are rolling out Windows based computers, you are pretty much guaranteed the 
	staff already have a pretty good understanding about what they're doing because Windows is literally everywhere.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">So yeah, for sure, if everyone had the same understanding of Linux as they do with Windows 
	then I believe it would open the door wider for much better opportunities to implement Linux into the business sector.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>What are your thoughts on digital rights, privacy and copyright?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Digital rights is a core pillar of what we do at Freedom Publishers Union.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Digital rights and privacy need serious reform, there is no doubt about that.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">It's an incredibly outdated area of legislation.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The legislative instruments that govern digital rights and privacy are terribly outdated 
	and were drafted at a time which is just so irrelevant to now.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The amount of new privacy-eroding legislation that has been introduced since the terror 
	attacks of September 11 in 2001 is just mind boggling.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">And as each of these pieces of legislation has been introduced, they've gradually been 
	eating away at the effectiveness of privacy laws which have gone abandoned and not been amended to keep up with laws that erode privacy.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Things don't look any brighter with copyright.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Where privacy laws could still be fixed by serious amendments, I think copyright 
	specifically, is so outdated that we need to consider dropping the current laws altogether.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Not to create a free for all creative environment, but instead we need to redraft new 
	laws that can be developed around the way digital media is consumed now.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Applying ineffective amendments to old copyright legislation has proven 
	fruitless.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">We've tried that before and it simply hasn't worked.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Let's try something fresh which could genuinely benefit creators and consumers while also 
	including fair use provisions.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I think the latter is important because let's be honest here, many of the copyright legal 
	cases that have been put forth by production companies have been targeting individuals that have posed absolutely no genuine threat to the financial 
	futures of these companies.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">They've been David versus Goliath battles.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Bullying, really.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Yet the legal attacks continue without restraint, for what I feel is simply to set an 
	example of the dominance of production companies.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Inclusion of fair use provisions in copyright law could stop all that by providing a 
	certain amount of protection for the little guy.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Digital rights is an area I am very active in with my political work.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%"><b>Parting thoughts?</b></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Stop being complacent.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The world isn't perfect and there is so many problems that could be addressed, but it 
	starts with people just standing up and bringing attention to the problems.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I was much too complacent at a young age.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">I'm making up for it now, but if something is genuinely bothering you and you think 
	there's another way it should be done, a better way, then what are you waiting for?</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">If you don't like proprietary software, advocate for and switch to Linux.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">If you don't like commercial media, support independent media.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Or if you feel you have more to say on an issue but can't cut through the social media 
	hashtag rhetoric, then start your own website and start writing.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">There is so many ways to get your message across now.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Take advantage of these exciting times.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">The world doesn't have to be a dark place if you choose to be the one to switch the light 
	on.</div></font>
	<font color="gold"><div align="left" style="font-size:50%">Thank you again for this opportunity Mislav. I've had fun.</div></font><br>
